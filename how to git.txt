//This is my personal cheatsheet because I keep forgetting commands and running into random problems 

git pull origin main //because i can't just like normally pull for some reason
git checkout -b <branchname> //make new branch

//for emergencies only
git push origin main

git merge <merge_to> <merge_from>

ok if main is empty, but we made a branch that isn't it gets real grumpy so:

git checkout <branch>
git branch main <branch> -f
git checkout main
git push origin main -f

solves problem: "entirely different commit histories"

------------------------------
fun fact, changing the repo name leads to a small cascade of issues xD
in this case worth it, but I wouldn't do it again
